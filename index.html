                <h3>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website!
                    My name is Victor Tung and I'm a Senior studying Computer Science at the 
                    University of Delaware. Besides coding, my interests include PC hardware, investing, 
                    and gaming. I am a quick learner who is detail-oriented and loves solving problems. 
                    My aim is to become a Software Engineer in the near future. Feel free to check out 
                    some of the projects I have below.</h3>

                    <h2>Pathfinding Visualizer</h2>
                    <p>Pathfinding visualizer project featuring both weighted and unweighted 
                        graphs. Currently, BFS and Dijkstra are the only algorithms that have 
                        been implemented. I built this project mainly as a way to learn more 
                        about JavaScipt and React and because I simply thought that pathfinding 
                        algorithms were cool.</p>

                    <p>Interactive Sudoku interface where you can solve a random puzzle or input 
                        your own puzzle to solve. There is also a solver utilizing the 
                        backtracking algorithm that lets you know if your solution is correct 
                        and with which you can use to solve the puzzle. Built using Python
                        and the Pygame library.</p>

                    <h2>PCMart</h2>
                    <p>This was a project that I worked on in collaboration with others for 
                        CISC275. It is an e-commerce website for PC parts built using 
                        TypeScript, JavaScript, and React. Currently, the project is 
                        almost entirely frontend, with a little bit of firebase for the 
                        backend. The project was built over the course of ~6 weeks with 
                        an agile methodology via 1-week sprints.</p>

                        I built this as my final coding project when I was a Freshman.
